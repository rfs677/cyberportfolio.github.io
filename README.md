I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective
My objective is to use my mindset as a life long learner to secure networks and protect organizations and individuals form malicious actors and to provide education in safely navigating our digital world. 

I am now eager to transition my extensive IT experience into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
